# Story 1.1: Critical Backend Consolidation & Data Model Standardization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to consolidate the duplicate backend implementations and standardize all data models,
**so that** we eliminate confusion, reduce maintenance overhead, and ensure data consistency across the entire system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Single Backend Implementation**: Only one backend directory (`/backend/`) remains, with all features from both implementations consolidated
2. **Standardized Customer Model**: One canonical Customer model definition used throughout the entire codebase
3. **Consolidated Webhook Handlers**: Single, production-ready webhook implementation with all debug/old versions removed
4. **Data Migration Script**: Automated script to ensure data consistency between old and new schema
5. **Updated Deployment Configuration**: All deployment scripts, Docker files, and CI/CD pipelines point to the consolidated backend
6. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing API endpoints continue to work as expected
7. **Documentation Updated**: Architecture documentation reflects the new consolidated structure

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the technical debt remediation epic. No previous story context available.

### Data Models
**Current State Analysis:**
- **Version 1** in `backend/app/models/customer.py`: Fields include `name`, `phone`, `language`
- **Version 2** in `backend-python/models.py`: Fields include `full_name`, `phone_number`, `preferred_language`, `restaurant_id`
- **Version 3** in route handlers: Ad-hoc dictionaries with `customer_name`, `contact_phone`

**Canonical Model Definition** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#inconsistent-customer-model]:
```python
class Customer:
    id: int
    full_name: str
    phone_number: str  # E.164 format
    preferred_language: str  # ISO 639-1 code
    restaurant_id: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

### API Specifications
**Webhook Consolidation Requirements** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#multiple-webhook-implementations]:
- Primary webhook: `/backend/app/routes/webhook.py` (450 lines)
- Deprecated: `webhook_old.py`, `webhook_stable.py`
- Debug version: `webhook_ultra_debug.py` (should not be in production)
- **Target**: Single production webhook with proper logging instead of debug versions

### Component Specifications
**Backend Structure** [Source: architecture/README.md#proposed-backend-structure]:
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/          # Standardized SQLAlchemy models
│   ├── routes/          # API endpoints (webhook.py only)
│   ├── services/        # Business logic extraction point
│   └── core/           # Configuration and utilities
```

### File Locations
**Primary Files to Modify**:
- `/backend/app/models/customer.py` - Canonical model
- `/backend/app/routes/webhook.py` - Consolidated webhook
- `/backend/requirements.txt` or `/pyproject.toml` - Dependencies

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/README.md#testing-requirements]:
- Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- Integration tests for consolidated webhook
- Database migration tests
- API endpoint compatibility tests
- Performance impact testing for consolidated system

**Database Migration Requirements** [Source: architecture/README.md#database-layer]:
- Use Alembic for schema changes
- Support SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production) compatibility
- Ensure zero-downtime migration capability
- Backup existing data before migration

**Compatibility Requirements** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#resolution]:
- All existing API clients must continue working
- WhatsApp webhook URL must remain functional
- No changes to external service integrations
- Maintain current authentication mechanisms

- **Test Location**: `/backend/tests/` directory structure
- **Test Frameworks**: pytest for unit tests, pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **Coverage Requirement**: Minimum 80% code coverage
