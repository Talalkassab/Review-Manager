## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Dependencies**: This story requires completion of both Story 1.1 (Backend Consolidation) and Story 1.2 (Architecture Cleanup). The clean service layer and properly structured codebase are prerequisites for effective testing and monitoring.

**Technical Foundation**: With the consolidated backend and clean architecture from previous stories, this final story focuses on production readiness, quality assurance, and operational excellence.

### Testing Strategy Architecture
**Current State** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#missing-tests]:
- 0% test coverage currently
- No unit tests found
- No integration tests
- Target: Minimum 80% coverage

**Testing Framework Stack**:
- **Unit Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async support
- **Integration Testing**: pytest with test database (SQLite in-memory)
- **API Testing**: httpx client for FastAPI testing
- **Mock Framework**: pytest-mock for external service mocking
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov for coverage reporting

**Priority Test Areas** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#resolution]:
1. Authentication flows
2. Customer CRUD operations  
3. WhatsApp message handling
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Analytics calculations

### Database Performance Optimization
**Current N+1 Query Problems** [Source: architecture/technical-debt.md#inefficient-database-queries]:
```python
# Current problematic pattern:
customers = session.query(Customer).all()
for customer in customers:
    feedbacks = session.query(Feedback).filter_by(
        customer_id=customer.id
    ).all()  # N queries executed!
```

**Optimized Approach**:
```python
# Use eager loading and proper joins
customers = session.query(Customer).options(
    selectinload(Customer.feedbacks)
).all()
```

**Required Database Indexes**:
- `customers.phone_number` (frequently queried for WhatsApp lookup)
- `feedback.customer_id` (foreign key relationship)
- `feedback.created_at` (for date range queries)
- `customers.restaurant_id` (multi-tenant queries)

### Logging Architecture
**Structured Logging Format**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-09-11T10:00:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "correlation_id": "req_abc123",
  "service": "whatsapp_service",
  "message": "Message sent successfully",
  "context": {
    "customer_id": 456,
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "response_time_ms": 234
  }
}
```

**Log Categories**:
- **Application Logs**: Business logic events
- **Performance Logs**: API response times, database query performance
- **Security Logs**: Authentication events, rate limit violations
- **Integration Logs**: External service calls and responses

### Performance Monitoring
**Key Metrics to Track** [Source: architecture/README.md - Monitoring & Observability section]:
- API endpoint response times (95th percentile)
- Database query execution times
- External service latency (Twilio, OpenRouter)
- Memory and CPU usage
- Connection pool utilization
- Error rates by endpoint

**Health Check Endpoints**:
- `/health` - Basic application health
- `/health/ready` - Readiness for traffic (DB connected, services available)
- `/health/live` - Liveness check for restart decisions

### Security Implementation
**Rate Limiting Strategy**:
- Webhook endpoints: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Customer API endpoints: 60 requests/minute per user
- Public endpoints: 30 requests/minute per IP

**Input Validation Requirements**:
- Phone number format validation (E.164 format)
- Message content sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention in API responses

- Database query execution < 100ms average - excluding complex analytics queries
- Webhook processing < 500ms end-to-end - from Twilio receipt to response
- System uptime > 99.5% - excluding planned maintenance windows

**Testing Requirements**:
- All tests must be runnable in CI environment
- Integration tests must use isolated test database
- Mock external services (no real API calls during testing)
- Tests must be deterministic and repeatable

### Testing
**Testing Standards for This Story**:
- **Test Location**: `/backend/tests/` with proper structure (unit/integration/e2e)

  - Test files (tests/ directory)
  - Database migrations (alembic/versions/)
