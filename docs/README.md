# Customer WhatsApp Agent - Documentation Hub

## üìã Documentation Overview

This documentation hub provides comprehensive information about the Customer WhatsApp Agent system architecture, requirements, and improvement roadmap.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
The Customer WhatsApp Agent is a bilingual (Arabic/English) restaurant feedback management system that:

- **Automates** customer outreach via WhatsApp using Twilio
- **Collects** customer feedback with AI-powered sentiment analysis  
- **Routes** positive feedback to Google Reviews, negative to management
- **Provides** real-time analytics dashboard for restaurant owners

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 13+ with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, Pydantic v2, FastAPI-Users
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- **AI:** OpenRouter integration (Claude, GPT-4, Llama models)
- **Communication:** Twilio WhatsApp Business API
- **Analytics:** Google Maps/Business API integration

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Core Documents
- **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./prd/PRD.md)** - Complete product specification and requirements
- **[Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md)** - System architecture, components, and refactoring roadmap
- **[Technical Debt Analysis](./architecture/technical-debt.md)** - Detailed code quality issues and remediation plan
- **[Sprint Change Proposal](./SPRINT_CHANGE_PROPOSAL.md)** - Action plan for technical debt remediation

### Quick Reference
- **[System Overview](./architecture/README.md#system-overview)** - High-level system description
- **[Critical Issues](./architecture/technical-debt.md#critical-p0---immediate-action-required)** - P0 issues requiring immediate attention
- **[Refactoring Roadmap](./architecture/README.md#refactoring-roadmap)** - 4-phase improvement plan

## üö® Current Status: Action Required

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Duplicate Backend Implementation** - Two complete FastAPI backends exist
2. **Multiple Webhook Handlers** - 4 different webhook implementations
3. **Inconsistent Data Models** - Multiple Customer model definitions
4. **Zero Test Coverage** - No automated testing
5. **Poor Code Organization** - Business logic mixed with API routes

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Review** the Sprint Change Proposal for technical debt remediation
2. **Approve** the 4-sprint focused refactoring campaign
3. **Begin** Sprint 1 critical fixes (remove duplicates, standardize models)

## üìà Project Health Dashboard

### Technical Debt Metrics
- **Code Duplication:** 35% (target: <5%)
- **Test Coverage:** 0% (target: >80%)  
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 15 avg (target: <10)
- **Documentation Coverage:** 20% ‚Üí 85% ‚úÖ

### Risk Assessment
- **Development Velocity Risk:** HIGH (40% degradation expected if not addressed)
- **Maintenance Cost Risk:** HIGH (3x increase in bug fixes)
- **Scalability Risk:** MEDIUM (architecture not prepared for growth)

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Before You Start
1. Read the [Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md) to understand the system
2. Review [Technical Debt Issues](./architecture/technical-debt.md) to avoid contributing to problems
3. Check the [Sprint Change Proposal](./SPRINT_CHANGE_PROPOSAL.md) for current priorities

### Development Guidelines
- **No direct commits** to main branch
- **Mandatory PR reviews** with quality checklist
- **Follow single responsibility principle** - keep business logic in services
- **Add tests** for all new functionality
- **Use type hints** and document public APIs

### Current Priorities
1. **Sprint 1 (Current):** Remove duplicate backend, consolidate webhooks
2. **Sprint 2:** Implement service layer, configuration management  
3. **Sprint 3:** Add testing framework, API versioning
4. **Sprint 4:** Performance optimization, monitoring

## üìä Business Context

### Product Value Proposition
- **40%+ customer response rate** to WhatsApp outreach
- **3-5x increase** in monthly Google Reviews
- **2-hour response time** for negative feedback escalation
- **<2 hours/week** manual intervention required

### Success Metrics
- **Feedback Collection Rate:** 40%+ customer responses
- **Review Conversion Rate:** 60%+ positive feedback ‚Üí Google Reviews
- **Issue Detection Speed:** <2 hours for negative feedback alerts
- **System Reliability:** 99.5% uptime during business hours

### Target Users
- **Primary:** Restaurant owners/managers (1-8 locations)
- **Secondary:** Restaurant staff (monitoring and response)
