# Product Requirements Document: AI Customer Feedback Agent

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Summary
The AI Customer Feedback Agent is an intelligent multilingual automation system (Arabic/English) that includes a web interface for entering new restaurant customer transactions, monitors an embedded database for new customer data, automatically reaches out via WhatsApp to collect feedback about their dining experience in the customer's preferred language, and intelligently routes positive feedback to Google Maps reviews while flagging negative feedback for management attention.

### 1.2 Background and Strategic Fit
The restaurant industry faces intense competition where online reputation directly impacts customer acquisition. With 97% of consumers reading online reviews for local businesses and 85% trusting them as much as personal recommendations, proactive review management has become critical for restaurant success. However, most restaurants struggle with manual, inconsistent feedback collection processes that miss opportunities for positive reviews and fail to identify service issues before they become public complaints.

This AI agent addresses a critical gap in restaurant customer relationship management by automating the entire feedback collection and routing process, enabling restaurants to build stronger online reputations while identifying and resolving issues proactively.

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **Feedback Collection Rate:** 40%+ of contacted customers respond to initial WhatsApp outreach
- **Review Conversion Rate:** 60%+ of positive feedback converts to Google Maps reviews  
- **Review Volume Growth:** 3-5x increase in monthly Google Reviews
- **Issue Detection Speed:** Negative feedback identified and escalated within 2 hours
- **Customer Satisfaction:** 4.5+ average rating from collected feedback
- **Operational Efficiency:** <2 hours per week of manual intervention required
